Flexibility:  the ability to add any objects as extensions. Commands  are grouped into execute. Pass parameters as lists in case number of parameters increate in the future.
Distinction of back end and frontend: the turtle is in the backend on which processing is done. The gui only gets to show its new states when there is change.

History: it is in the backend. When history is updated it notifies the gui via observe/able

Pen is a method.

History  of legitimate commands

Right now the parser uses an expression tree. We have not formally decided how to make the nodes of the tree.

Exceptions:  

command format , syntax

does the function exist

is the number of parameters correct

is the type of parameter correct 

part two:

started with the turtle: what something that I can run on the screen. Then I will add commands to it. We also have Skelton classes of the inheritance hierarchy
