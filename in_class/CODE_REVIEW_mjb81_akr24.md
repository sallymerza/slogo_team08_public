# Peer Code Review #

Matthew Battles, Team 14, and Alex Rice, Team 8
===================================
In class on October 15, 2015 we discussed the overall layout of the GUI, some of the classes composing the GUI, and the ViewController class that intends to connect the view and the model. The layout is organized and clean, but most of the components lack any real power. This is due to the lack of complete ViewController and ModelController classes. Without these classes, the GUI has no real connection to the model and, thus, cannot receive nor provide information. The first step tonight is to complete these classes so the program is reactive visually and analytically. As well, the buttons class could be renamed and refactored to be a VBox of a run button and a clear button.
