#API Review

Both of our designs is flexible because it it will pass objects with the needed parameters to the back and front ends, rather than a bunch of parameters.


We also think our designs are good because they have a clear heirarchy that allows a super-object to pass only the needed information to the different views and models.

We do not have much running at this time.  Alex has a view with a console.  I have a nicely named file.  I am so excited to work on the Display, because I used to work with Logo in elementary school, and the turtle is bae.

Alex is excited to work on the history bar because history was his second choice of major.
