##API REVIEW
Karen Li (kjl32) and Efe Aras (ea89)

###Part1
1. By using an extensive inheritance hierarchy, we allow for easy integration of new components into our project.
2. We have a GUI Manager class that instantiates every component in our GUI.
3. We will catch the exceptions thrown by the back end and display a popup.
4. Our design is good because we separate all our components into different components. 

###Part2
Use cases:
1. Get text pressed on "Enter" in the console box.
2. Double click on "History"
3. Change image of the turtle.
4. Adding new tabs and extensions.

I am most excited about getting the History commands to successfully work.
I am most worried about how we will format the controller and how we will pass information between front-end and back-end.
